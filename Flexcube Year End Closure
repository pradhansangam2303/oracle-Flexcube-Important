Typically banks close books annually. The closure of books involves transfer of the P&L to the retained earnings accounts (Liability account) specified at the GL level (GLTM_GLMASTER.PROFIT_ACC or GLTM_GLMASTER.LOSS_ACC)
The Year Closure is done by GLFINCLO by calling glpks_misc.fn_year_close
Before the year close, the balances from the last user maintained period of the year (e.g. M12) are copied onto the period FIN. 
The branch period code is updated to FIN and the Year Closure entries are passed. The branch period code is then updated back to M12.
The date change function at the year end copies the balances from FIN to the first period of the next financial cycle.
